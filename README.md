# ARPN
The code part of paper "Autoencoder-Enhanced Regularized Prototypical Network for New Energy Vehicle Battery Fault Detection".
Used to deal with new energy vehicle battery fault detection. The problem of class imbalance is effectively solved.

Input samples are passed through a neural network to obtain their embeddings or feature representations. This mapping function is often referred to as the "encoder." For each class, the network computes the prototype by taking the mean of the embeddings of all the samples belonging to that class. The prototype essentially represents the "average" or central representation of the class. A distance metric, such as the Euclidean distance or cosine similarity, is used to measure the similarity between the embeddings of a query sample and the prototypes of each class. During inference, a query sample is compared to the prototypes of all classes using the distance metric. The class whose prototype is the closest to the query sample is assigned as the predicted class for the sample. Prototypical networks are trained using episodes, where each episode simulates a few-shot learning task. An episode consists of a support set (few samples per class) and a query set (samples to be classified). The model is optimized to minimize the cross-entropy loss between the predicted class probabilities and the ground truth labels in the query set. These are the means by which the prototypical network deals with few-shot learning problems, and it has been experimentally proven that this approach is extremely effective.

The ARPN is equivalent to an improved network developed on the basis of the prototypical network to address the problems of this project. The severe imbalance between normal and faulty data samples is a key challenge, as traditional methods fail to learn from the limited faulty examples. ARPN incorporates several techniques to overcome this.
